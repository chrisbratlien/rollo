#TODO: add another improv lambda for either lead or bassline.  provide functions like
# aggregate row and column density so lambdas can decide to "fill in the gaps" a little.
# especially the :lead improv because melodies are more like the plotted line, and less
# like the x-axis.  the key vs the pins and tumblers,
# also, what about a :kamikaze lambda whose performance is to dodge the obstacles in
# the current measure, survivng long enough to crash into an obstacle at the beginning
# of the next measure  (ok that's just a walking bassline stated more dramatically)
